Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific area.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are **very significant and ongoing new developments in drug discovery powered by AI**. It's one of the most dynamic areas in AI for healthcare. Here's a breakdown of the latest trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Design:** This is perhaps the most exciting advancement. Generative AI models (like those based on GANs, VAEs, and transformers) can now design entirely new molecules from scratch, rather than just screening existing libraries. They can be trained to create molecules with specific desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target protein, favorable pharmacokinetics, low toxicity).\n*   **Optimizing Existing Leads:** AI can take a promising but imperfect molecule and suggest modifications to improve its properties, making it a more viable drug candidate.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are reporting the discovery of novel drug candidates for diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and various cancers using these generative approaches. Some of these candidates are already entering preclinical and even early clinical trials.\n\n**2. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering New Disease Drivers:** AI can sift through massive datasets of genomic, proteomic, and clinical information to identify novel biological targets that play a crucial role in disease development. This goes beyond well-understood pathways.\n*   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":** AI models are getting better at predicting whether a newly identified target is likely to be amenable to drug intervention, saving researchers time and resources.\n\n**3. Accelerating Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI is being used to predict Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates much earlier in the process. This helps weed out molecules likely to fail in later stages due to poor pharmacokinetics or safety concerns.\n*   **In Silico Screening and Simulation:** AI can simulate how drug candidates will interact with biological systems, reducing the need for some costly and time-consuming wet-lab experiments.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict patient response to a drug, which is crucial for personalized medicine and clinical trial design.\n\n**4. Improving Clinical Trial Design and Patient Recruitment:**\n\n*   **Predicting Clinical Trial Success:** AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of a drug succeeding in clinical trials based on preclinical data and historical trial outcomes.\n*   **Optimizing Patient Stratification:** AI can identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from a particular drug, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Faster Patient Recruitment:** AI can analyze electronic health records (EHRs) to identify eligible patients for clinical trials more quickly and accurately.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs with AI:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze drug-disease relationships, gene expression data, and protein-protein interaction networks to identify existing drugs that might be effective against new diseases. This is a faster and cheaper route to new therapies.\n\n**Key Players and Examples:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-driven platform that has brought several novel drug candidates into clinical trials, including for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, identifying potential small-molecule drugs for various diseases.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on AI-driven discovery and design of novel drug candidates, having partnered with major pharmaceutical companies.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Leverages AI and automation to map cellular biology and discover new drug targets and therapies.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** The effectiveness of AI in drug discovery heavily relies on the quality, quantity, and accessibility of biological and chemical data.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation, which can be a bottleneck.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model predicts a certain outcome is still an area of active research, especially for complex biological systems.\n*   **Regulatory Acceptance:** Ensuring that AI-generated insights meet regulatory standards for drug approval is an ongoing process.\n\nIn summary, AI is no longer just a buzzword in drug discovery; it's a powerful engine driving innovation. We're seeing a tangible acceleration in the pace of identifying and developing new therapeutic candidates, with the promise of more personalized and effective treatments in the future.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which is:\n\n**AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation.**\n\nThis area is crucial because before you can develop a drug, you need to know *what* you're trying to treat at a molecular level. For a long time, this was a process heavily reliant on serendipity, deep biological expertise, and laborious experimentation. AI is changing this by enabling a more systematic and data-driven approach.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this development entails:\n\n**What is a Drug Target?**\n\nA drug target is typically a specific molecule in the body (often a protein or gene) that plays a critical role in a disease. By interacting with this target (either inhibiting it or activating it), a drug can help to alleviate or cure the disease.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n\n1.  **Analyzing Massive, Multi-Omic Datasets:**\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can analyze vast amounts of genomic data from patients with a specific disease, looking for genetic variations (mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms - SNPs) that are consistently present and linked to disease development or progression.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI can examine gene expression levels (which genes are \"turned on\" or \"turned off\" at different levels) in diseased tissues versus healthy tissues. This helps pinpoint genes and pathways that are dysregulated.\n    *   **Proteomics:** AI can analyze protein levels and their interactions. This is vital because proteins are often the direct effectors of biological processes and the most common type of drug target.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can analyze the small molecules (metabolites) produced by cells, providing insights into metabolic pathways that are altered in disease.\n    *   **Clinical Data:** AI can integrate this \"omic\" data with patient clinical records (symptoms, disease stage, treatment response) to build a more holistic picture.\n\n2.  **Identifying Novel Disease Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Beyond Known Pathways:** Traditional research often focuses on well-understood biological pathways. AI can uncover novel, complex relationships between genes, proteins, and cellular processes that are not immediately obvious to human researchers.\n    *   **Systems Biology Approach:** AI enables a more \"systems biology\" approach, looking at how entire networks of molecules function together, rather than just individual components. This is key to understanding complex diseases.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n    *   **Is it a Good Target?** Even if AI identifies a molecule strongly associated with a disease, it doesn't automatically mean it's a good target for a drug.\n    *   **AI for Druggability Assessment:** AI models can be trained on data about known drug targets and drugs that interact with them. They can then predict:\n        *   **Binding Site Availability:** Does the target have a suitable pocket or surface where a drug molecule can bind?\n        *   **Modulatability:** Can the target's activity be effectively modulated (inhibited or activated) by a small molecule or biologic?\n        *   **Selectivity:** Can a drug target this molecule specifically without causing significant off-target effects?\n        *   **\"Druggable Genome\" Analysis:** AI can help assess the overall landscape of potential targets within an organism's genome and proteome.\n\n**Benefits of AI-Driven Target ID & Validation:**\n\n*   **Speed:** Significantly faster than traditional hypothesis-driven research.\n*   **Breadth:** Explores a much wider range of possibilities than human intuition alone.\n*   **Novelty:** Uncovers truly new targets and disease mechanisms, leading to first-in-class drugs.\n*   **Efficiency:** Reduces wasted effort on targets that are unlikely to yield viable drugs.\n*   **Personalization:** Can identify targets specific to certain patient subgroups.\n\n**Examples in Action:**\n\n*   Researchers using AI to identify novel targets for neurodegenerative diseases by analyzing patterns in brain imaging and genetic data.\n*   AI platforms sifting through patient tumor data to find specific mutated proteins that are driving cancer growth and are potential targets for immunotherapy.\n*   AI helping to validate targets for rare diseases by integrating disparate data sources where human expertise might be limited.\n\nThis development is foundational. Without good targets, even the most advanced molecule design algorithms will struggle. AI is making the identification and validation of these critical starting points more robust, data-driven, and ultimately, more successful.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in **AI-powered target identification and validation** in drug discovery. This is a very active space, and while many companies contribute, some are specifically known for their expertise in this area, either as platform providers or as companies using these platforms for their own drug pipelines.\n\nHere are some of the key players, categorized broadly:\n\n**1. Dedicated AI Drug Discovery Platform Companies (Often with Strong Target ID Capabilities):**\n\nThese companies have built their core technology around AI and machine learning to identify novel targets and then often use that information to design drugs.\n\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** They use automated biological imaging and AI to map cellular disease phenotypes and identify novel targets and drug candidates. Their platform is heavily focused on understanding the underlying biology and finding new points of intervention.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** They leverage AI and machine learning to analyze vast amounts of scientific literature, patents, clinical trial data, and other sources to generate novel hypotheses about disease biology and identify new drug targets.\n*   **Exscientia:** While also renowned for molecule design, Exscientia uses AI to analyze complex biological data to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets. They aim to understand the disease context and pinpoint the most promising intervention points.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for their end-to-end AI platform, Insilico's target discovery engine plays a crucial role in their process. They identify novel targets and then move rapidly into preclinical development.\n*   **Atomwise:** While primarily focused on small-molecule drug discovery, their deep learning models can also analyze complex biological data to suggest novel targets.\n*   **Schrödinger:** Primarily known for its physics-based computational chemistry platform, Schrödinger is increasingly incorporating AI and machine learning to enhance its target identification and validation capabilities, particularly in understanding protein behavior.\n*   **Deep Genomics:** Focuses on using AI to understand the genetic basis of disease and identify novel targets, particularly in RNA regulation.\n\n**2. Big Pharma Companies with Internal AI Capabilities:**\n\nMajor pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in building their own internal AI capabilities, including specialized teams for target identification and validation.\n\n*   **Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Merck, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Roche:** These giants are all actively building or acquiring AI expertise. They employ data scientists, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists to analyze their proprietary datasets (genomic, proteomic, clinical) to uncover new targets. They often partner with AI platform companies as well.\n\n**3. Specialized AI/Bioinformatics Companies:**\n\nSome companies focus on specific aspects of data analysis that are critical for target identification.\n\n*   **Tempus:** While known for its AI-driven precision medicine platform for cancer, Tempus's ability to analyze large-scale clinical and molecular data is invaluable for identifying disease-driving targets.\n*   **Genomics and Proteomics Companies:** Companies that generate high-quality genomic and proteomic data often have internal analytics teams or partner with AI firms to help their clients (and themselves) derive insights and identify targets.\n\n**4. Academic and Research Institutions:**\n\nIt's important to remember that a lot of foundational research in AI for target ID comes from academic labs. These institutions often spin out companies or license their technologies.\n\n**How They Work Together:**\n\n*   **Partnerships and Collaborations:** Many AI platform companies partner with big pharma. The pharma company might provide data and biological expertise, while the AI company provides the technology to analyze it and discover targets.\n*   **Acquisitions:** Larger companies sometimes acquire smaller, innovative AI-focused biotech firms to gain their technology and talent.\n\n**Key Trend:**\n\nThe trend is towards a convergence. Big pharma is building in-house AI power, while AI-native companies are maturing and demonstrating success in identifying viable targets that lead to actual drug candidates. The ability to integrate diverse data types (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, clinical, literature) using sophisticated AI algorithms is what makes this development so powerful.\n\nWhen looking at companies in this space, consider their focus: Are they primarily a platform company selling technology, or are they a biotech company using AI to discover their *own* drugs? Both approaches are driving progress.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
