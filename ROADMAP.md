## Phase 1: Pre-Course Hype (Nov 7-9, 2025)

### Post #1: The Announcement (Day 1 - Today)
**Type:** Carousel or single post with repo screenshot

```
🚀 I'm joining Google's 5-Day AI Agents Intensive (Nov 10-14)

Just scaffolded my learning repo with Claude Code in under 10 minutes.
Here's what I'm diving into:

Day 1: Introduction to Agents & Agentic Architectures
Day 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability
Day 3: Context Engineering & Memory
Day 4: Quality, Logging & Evaluation
Day 5: Prototype to Production & Capstone Project

Following along?

🎥 Livestreams: 21:00 IL daily

Who else is taking this challenge?

#GoogleAIAgentsIntensive #AIAgents #GoogleAI #LearningInPublic
```

**Why it works:**
- Announces commitment (accountability)
- Invites others to join
- Shows you're already taking action (repo link)
- Hashtags attract right audience

### Post #2: The Setup Story (Nov 8-9)
**Type:** Short video or carousel

```
How I built my AI Agents learning workspace with Claude Code 🤖

Went from empty repo → fully structured project in minutes:
✅ 5 day folders with notebook stubs
✅ Resource docs with all course links
✅ Security-first .gitignore (no leaked API keys!)
✅ Cost estimator for Gemini API
✅ Contributing guidelines

This is what "vibe coding" with AI assistants looks like.

The best part? I spent more time thinking about WHAT I needed than HOW to create it.

That's the future of development.

**Why it works:**
- Shows practical AI tool usage
- Teaches while promoting
- Demonstrates efficiency gains
- "Vibe coding" is catchy/memorable

## Phase 3: Weekend Deep Dive (Nov 15-16)

### Post #6: The Reflection Post
**Type:** Long-form article or detailed post

```
5 days. 5 AI agent lessons. One capstone project. 🧵

Just wrapped Google's AI Agents Intensive. Here's what I learned that most tutorials don't teach:

1/ Agents fail gracefully (or catastrophically)
[Lesson about error handling and guardrails]

2/ Memory ≠ RAG (but they work great together)
[Insight about agent memory systems]

3/ Evaluation is HARDER than building
[The challenge of measuring agent performance]

4/ Multi-agent systems are the future
[Why specialized agents > one mega-agent]

5/ The tooling gap is real
[What's missing in the agent ecosystem]

My capstone project: [Description + link]

Built entirely with Claude Code for the heavy lifting.

## Phase 4: Post-Course Authority Building (Nov 17+)

### Post #8: The Tutorial (Week after)
**Type:** Step-by-step guide

```
Want to build your first AI agent? Here's a 5-minute tutorial 🧵

No PhD required. No complex frameworks. Just Python + Gemini API.

I'll show you how to build a research agent that:
✅ Takes a question
✅ Searches multiple sources
✅ Synthesizes an answer
✅ Cites its sources

[Code snippet or video walkthrough]

Full code in my repo: [link]

Built this during Google's AI Agents Intensive. My notes are open-source.

### Post #9: The Thought Leadership Piece
**Type:** Opinion/prediction post

```
Hot take: "Vibe coding" is the new pair programming 🔥

After building AI agents with Claude Code as my co-pilot, I realized:

Traditional coding:
1. Think about the problem
2. Search Stack Overflow
3. Write boilerplate
4. Debug syntax errors
5. Solve the actual problem

Vibe coding:
1. Think about the problem
2. Describe what you want
3. AI generates structure
4. You focus on the hard parts
5. Iterate with AI feedback

I'm not replacing developers. I'm 10x-ing my velocity.

My AI Agents Intensive project? Built in 1/3 the time I'd normally need.

The skills that matter now:
✅ System design
✅ Prompt engineering
✅ Problem decomposition
✅ Code review (AI-generated)
❌ Memorizing syntax

The future developer is an architect, not a typist.

## 🎨 Content Best Practices

### Visual Strategy
1. **Code screenshots** with syntax highlighting
2. **Architecture diagrams** (use Excalidraw, draw.io)
3. **Before/After** comparisons
4. **Short screen recordings** (Loom, 30-60 sec max)
5. **Carousel posts** for step-by-step content

### Engagement Tactics
- **Ask questions** at the end of every post
- **Tag relevant people/orgs**: @Kaggle @Google @Anthropic (Claude)
- **Reply to every comment** in first 2 hours
- **Engage with similar posts** before posting yours
- **Post timing**: 8-10am or 5-7pm IL time (when people commute/break)

### Hashtag Strategy

#### 🏷️ Primary (Official) Hashtag - ALWAYS USE THIS

**#GoogleAIAgentsIntensive**

This is the one Kaggle and Google are tracking across LinkedIn, Twitter (X), and Discord. It's also the one learners from the previous #GoogleGenAIIntensive are using to show continuity.

#### 🌍 Supporting / Discovery Hashtags

Add 2–4 of these depending on your post's focus:

**General AI Course:**

#### 📝 Hashtag Formula for Each Post

**Use this structure:**
1. Primary: #GoogleAIAgentsIntensive (always)
2. Focus-specific: 2-3 hashtags from relevant category above
3. Your signature: #VibeCoding (on posts showcasing Claude Code)
4. Community: 1-2 from community engagement

**Example combinations:**

*For daily updates:*
